A desktop-based Blood Bank Management System built in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL for database management.
This project is a standalone desktop application designed to streamline blood bank operations. It provides an intuitive GUI for managing donors, blood inventory, and requests, making it suitable for small blood banks or hospitals. Built with core Java concepts, JDBC for database connectivity, and Swing components for the interface—ideal as a college project, mini-project, or learning tool for OOP, GUI programming, and database integration.

Features:
-Donor Management: Add, update, view, search, and delete donor records (name, age, gender, blood group, contact, address, last donation date).
-Blood Stock Inventory: Track available blood units for each blood group (A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-). Update stock on donations or requests.
-Search Functionality: Quickly search donors by blood group, name, or location for emergency needs.
-Request Management: Handle blood requests from recipients or hospitals.
-Validation & Reports: Basic eligibility checks (e.g., age, donation frequency) and generate simple reports.
-User-Friendly Interface: Menu-driven Swing forms with tables, buttons, and dialogs for easy navigation.

Technologies Used:
Language: Java (Core Java, OOP principles)
GUI Framework: Java Swing (JFrame, JPanel, JTable, JButton, etc.)
Database: MySQL (with JDBC driver for connectivity)
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
No external dependencies beyond standard Java libraries and MySQL Connector
